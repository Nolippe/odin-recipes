        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken stuffed with a cheesy broccoli and mushroom filling. <br>
            Serve with a salad and roasted potatoes for a complete and satisfying meal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups finely chopped broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded pepperjack cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>4 small button mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 large chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Combine broccoli and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in the microwave on high power for 2 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Combine cooked broccoli, pepperjack cheese, mayonnaise, mushrooms, and garlic powder in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of each chicken breast with paprika, salt, and pepper. Use a sharp knife to cut a slice through the middle of each breast to create a deep pocket, making sure not to cut all the way through. Evenly stuff each breast with broccoli mixture and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
